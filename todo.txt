I'm thinking a nomansky kind of game but just solely on a dive mission. Like downwell but not as fast, but the worlds harsh, you're a clone. Also a bit of abyss inspiration

loving the idea of falling down very tight casm only for it to really open up into a cave, multi routes

Deaths are fast, funny, painful, sometimes comedic. 
Score based on depth and points added.

Stories help:
	your on a spaceship floating above one of jupiters moons (could be levels?!?!)
	The aim is to get to the bottom/source of water on a moon, through all the dangers. Deepest attempt compnay claims the moon? could be leaderboard style?

controls:
	boost down, jump
	left + right stroll.

boost down is the only weapon/action you have, left + right are cancelled on jump/boost.

Theres water currents that push and force you
water creatures
stalacites and staganites
underwater volcanos that will burn + force
breaking into caverns will kill you (water floods in and you fall to death)
thinking things from metroid verse

previous clones give points + boost (retrieved from players past a& server api) can be a tactic? Maybe even semi multiplayer aspect of teams helping?
